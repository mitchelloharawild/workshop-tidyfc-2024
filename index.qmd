## Course Overview

It is common for organizations to collect huge amounts of data over time, and existing time series analysis tools are not always suitable to handle the scale, frequency and structure of the data collected. In this workshop, we will look at some packages and methods that have been developed to handle the analysis of large collections of time series.

On day 1, we will look at the tsibble data structure for flexibly managing collections of related time series. We will look at how to do data wrangling, data visualizations, exploratory data analysis and produce forecasts with some simple techniques. Primary packages for day 1 will be [readabs](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readabs), [tsibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble), [lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lubridate) and [feasts](https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts) (along with the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org) of course).

Day 2 will be all about modelling and forecasting. We will look at some classical statistical models and how they are used for forecasting with the [fable](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fable) package. Building upon these statistical models, we will ensemble multiple models, incorporate policy into models and produce forecasts under various scenarios. Multivariate econometric modelling will allow us to investigate cointegration between measurements, understand the effect of economic shocks, and produce multivariate forecasts. Finally, we will briefly look at forecast reconciliation, allowing many time series to be forecast in a relatively short time while accounting for constraints on how the series are structurally related.

This workshop will run online and in-person on-site at the Department of Education in the second half of 2024.

## Learning objectives

Attendees will learn how to:

1. Wrangle time series data with familiar tidy tools.
2. Compute time series features and visualize large collections of time series.
3. Select accurate statistical forecasting models for your time series.
4. Investigate the relationships between measurements, and how one series impacts another using multivariate econometric modelling.
5. How to ensure forecasts of structurally related time series are coherent.

# Preparation

The workshop will provide a quick-start overview of exploring time series data and producing forecasts. There is no need for prior experience in time series to get the most out of this workshop.

It is expected that you are comfortable with writing R cod and using tidyverse packages including dplyr and ggplot2. If you are unfamiliar with writing R code or using the tidyverse, consider working through the learnr materials here: <https://learnr.numbat.space/>.

Some familiarity with statistical concepts such as the mean, variance, quantiles, normal distribution, and regression would be helpful to better understand the forecasts, although this is not strictly necessary.

## Required equipment

Please bring your own laptop capable of running R.

## Required software

To be able to complete the exercises of this workshop, please install a suitable IDE (such as RStudio), a recent version of R (4.1+) and the following packages.

-   **Time series packages and extensions**
    -   fpp3, sugrrants, MTS, urca
-   **tidyverse packages and friends**
    -   tidyverse, readabs, GGally

The following code will install the main packages needed for the workshop.

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "fpp3", "MTS", "urca", "readabs", "GGally", "sugrrants"))
```

Please have the required software installed and pre-work completed before attending the workshop.
