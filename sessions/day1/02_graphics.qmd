## Lab sessions

## Lab Session 3

1. Create time plots of the total school students and staff.
2. Create time plots of the total students and staff by state.
3. Use ggplot2 to create a time plot from scratch, complete with labels.

### Lab Session 4

1. Look at the monthly labour force of 15-24 year olds by State/Territory and educational attendance (6202.0 table 16).

   The code to prepare this data is in `student_labour.R`.

2. Use `autoplot()`, `gg_season()` and `gg_subseries()` to explore the data.

   Look at different aggregations of the data, for example total persons by
   attendance.
   
3. What do you learn?

### Lab Session 4

Explore the `ACF()` of the following time series:

1. Education payroll (`payroll_education`)
2. Total full-time students (`students`)
3. Total working students aged 15-24 in ACT (`student_labour`)

Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend? What do you learn about the series?

### Lab Session 5

Plot the difference in ACT student enrolments, it can be done as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
students |>
  filter(`State/Territory` == "ACT") |>
  summarise(total = sum(`All Full-time and Part-time Student count`)) |> 
  autoplot(difference(total))
```

Does `diff` look like white noise? Hint: Check the ACF
