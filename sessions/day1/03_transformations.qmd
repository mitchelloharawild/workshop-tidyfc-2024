## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 6

Consider the GDP information in `global_economy`. Plot the GDP per capita for each country over time. Which country has the highest GDP per capita? How has this changed over time?

### Lab Session 7


1. For the following series, find an appropriate transformation in order to stabilise the variance.

  * Number of arrivals to Australia from NZ (`aus_arrivals`)
  * Total full-time students (`students`)
  * Total full-time students aged 15-24 in Australia (`student_labour`)

2. Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the `canadian_gas` data?
