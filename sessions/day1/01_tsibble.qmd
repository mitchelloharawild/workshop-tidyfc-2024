## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 1


Create a tsibble for the annual number of in-school staff.

1. Download table 50a from the ABS Schools release.

   <https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/education/schools/latest-release>

2. Look at the data to see what it contains.

3. Identify the index and key variables to convert it into a tsibble with `as_tsibble()`.

4. How many time series does this dataset contain?

### Lab Session 2

With the annual number of in-school staff:

 5. Find which state has the most in-school staff in 2022.
 6. Create a new tsibble of total in-school staff for each state/territory and school type (affiliation 2).
 7. What is the typical difference in total number of male and female in-school staff? (try to visualise this!)
