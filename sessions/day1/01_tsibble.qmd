## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 1

 1. Use the `readabs` package to download and tidy the time series data from table `"19"` of the `"6202.0"` catalogue.
 2. Use `filter()` to remove time series relating to hours worked disaggregated by State/Territory. Also remove the aggregated time series (which specify `"Persons"`).
 3. Split the series column into two columns, `workload` and `sex` using the `separate()` function.
 4. Create a tsibble with the appropriate index and key variables, you will need to convert the date variable into a time variable with the appropriate granularity.
 5. Find which series contains the most worked hours.
 6. Create a new tsibble which aggregates over `sex`, and just has monthly worked hours by type.
 
### Lab Session 2

- Create time plots of the following four time series: `Bricks` from `aus_production`, `Lynx` from `pelt`, `Close` from `gafa_stock`, `Demand` from `vic_elec`.
- Use `help()` to find out about the data in each series.
- For the last plot, modify the axis labels and title.
