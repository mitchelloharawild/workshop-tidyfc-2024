## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 10

  * Use RW w/ drift to model total student enrolments in Australia (`students`).
  * Check the residuals, is $\varepsilon_t \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2)$?
  * Test if the residuals are white noise. What do you conclude?

### Lab Session 11

 * Create a training set for employed Australian students (`student_labour`) by withholding the last four years as a test set.
 * Fit all the appropriate benchmark methods to the training set and forecast the periods covered by the test set.
 * Compute the accuracy of your forecasts. Which method does best?
