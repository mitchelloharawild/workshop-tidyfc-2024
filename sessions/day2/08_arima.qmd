## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 16

For the Australian job vacancies:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
skill_vacancies <- readxl::read_excel("data/Internet Vacancies, ANZSCO Skill Level, States and Territories - May 2024.xlsx", sheet = 2) |> 
  # Tidy into a long form
  pivot_longer(matches("\\d{5}"), names_to = "month", values_to = "vacancies",
               names_transform = list(month = ~ yearmonth(as.Date(as.integer(.), origin = "1900-01-01")))) |> 
  # Remove aggregate vacancies
  filter(State != "AUST", Skill_level != 0) |> 
  # Convert to tsibble
  as_tsibble(key = c(State, Skill_level), index = month)
```


 * Fit a suitable ARIMA model (including possible transformation) for the data.
 * Produce forecasts of your fitted model. Do the forecasts look reasonable?

### Lab Session 17

For the Australian tourism data (from `tourism`):

 * Fit a suitable ARIMA model for all data.
 * Produce forecasts of your fitted models.
 * Check the forecasts for the "Snowy Mountains" and "Melbourne" regions. Do they look reasonable?
