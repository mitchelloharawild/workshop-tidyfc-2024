## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 14


For the total number of students in Government, Catholic, and Independent schools:

```{r}
#| eval: false
enrolment_affiliation <- students |> 
  group_by(`Affiliation (Gov/Cath/Ind)`) |> 
  summarise(enrolments = sum(`All Full-time and Part-time Student count`))
```

 * Fit a suitable ARIMA model (including possible transformation) for the data.
 * Produce forecasts of your fitted model. Do the forecasts look reasonable?

### Lab Session 15

Find an ARIMA model for the each school attendance type for people aged 15-24 in Australia (`student_labour`).

```{r}
#| eval: false
youth_learning <- student_labour |> 
  group_by(attendance) |> 
  summarise(persons = sum(persons))
```
  
 * Fit suitable ARIMA models for each time series.
 * Produce forecasts of your fitted models.
 * Check the forecasts for each of the school `attendance` category, do they look reasonable?
