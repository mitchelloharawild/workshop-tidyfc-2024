## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 16

Produce forecasts of preschool and school education jobs from the ABS payroll data (`payroll_education`).

```{r}
#| eval: false
payroll_education |> 
  filter(Industry == "Preschool and School Education")
```

1. Estimate a TSLM model with appropriate regression terms (trend, fourier harmonics, ...)
2. Produce and visualise forecasts from this model
3. Perform residual diagnostic checks on the model
4. Instead use dynamic harmonic regression
5. Do the residuals and forecasts look better?


### Lab Session 17

Consider the total school students aged 15-19 in Australia.

```{r}
#| eval: false
working_age_school_students <- student_labour |> 
  filter(attendance == "Attending school (aged 15-19 years)") |> 
  summarise(persons = sum(persons))
working_age_school_students |> autoplot(persons)
```

What if the 2013 policy was later reverted, what would you expect the forecasts to be?

1. Produce forecasts from a scenario in which this policy was reverted in 2030. 

   Hint: Use `new_data()` to create the future time points, and `mutate()` a date comparison to create the future dummy variable values.

2. Visualise the forecasts, are they realistic?
