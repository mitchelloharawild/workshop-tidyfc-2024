### Lab Session 18

Consider multivariate modelling of education staff affiliation.

```{r}
#| eval: false
staff_affiliation <- staff |> 
  group_by(`Affiliation 2`) |> 
  summarise(Count = sum(`In-School Staff Count`)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Affiliation 2`, values_from = Count)
```

1. Which model (VAR, VECM, or VARIMA) is most appropriate for this data?

2. Estimate a suitable multivariate model for this relationship.

3. Compute and visualise the impulse response functions.

4. Produce and visualise forecasts from the model.

### Lab Session 19

Produce coherent forecasts of the total number of students.

1. Produce aggregates of `students` by `State/Territory`, `Affiliation (Gov/Cath/Ind)` and `School Level`.

2. Estimate automatic ETS models on data before 2020.

3. Use optimal forecast reconciliation for these models.

4. Produce and plot 4 years of coherent and base forecasts.

5. Evaluate the test-set accuracy of these forecasts Are the coherent forecasts more accurate?
